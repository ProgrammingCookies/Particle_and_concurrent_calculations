# Particle_and_concurrent_calculations
A project done in Concurrent Programming where the path of particles were calculated concurrently.

This was a project done in concurrent programming ID1217 where the task was to calculate the trajectory of the different particles as concurrently and effectively as possible. The project was done together with Saga Harnesk, another student at KTH. 

During this project we got the opportunity to apply what we had learned from this course and we made the project in using C++ and we used openMP to make the calculations concurrent.

The zip folder contains and the files. The file serial.cpp contains the serial solution, the file openmp.cpp contains the concurrent solution done with openmp. The rest of the files are just supporting files that were created by the course teacher.
